## Runge Kutta 4th Order Interpretation

We are attempting to estimate the velocity using the "differential" of the 
calculated force. 

This means that each k1v, k2v, k3v, and k4v are all estimates of the slope of 
the velocity, or the acceleration. 

...Does this mean we need to recalculate/project the position at every kv and 
then calculate the force and use that to give the acceleration?

Following the above, everytime we calculate on of the kv's, we either need to 
estimate the location and then find the forces, or we need to just evolve the
previous force over our new time interval. 

If we just use the pre-calculated force, then the differential to calculate
acceleration becomes constant, which shouldn't really happen.

Ergo, we need to estimate the position of the atom after each sliver of time, 
then calculate the forces, then find the acceleration and set the velocity 
appropriately. 

Each call to "calc_accel()" should go like this:
* k1v: Estimation of the acceleration at the beginning of the time interval
** First, calculate the force given the current geometry of the molecule
** Then, acceleration can be found from F=ma

* k2v: Estimation of the acceleration halfway through the interval using k1v
** Now that we have an acceleration in the form of k1v, we use this value to
	project the value of the velocity at dt/2
** To do this, we set the calculated velocity at dt/2 to be:
*** current_vel + k1v(dt/2)
** Next, we use this velocity to project the coordinate value at time = dt/2
** This will be done using another RK4 method




# Scratch The Above... New Interpretation

We are really trying to estimate the POSITION of each atom after time=dt. This
means we need to use the RK4 method on position using velocity as the 
guiding "differential". However, velocity also needs to be calculated using 
its own guiding "differential", acceleration. Hence, at every step of the RK4
for position, we need to run RK4 on velocity to determine the correct velocity
at the time step. This then means we will run the force calculation 16 times 
for every step. 

Ergo, we need to calculate v1, v2, v3, and v4 (the 4 RK variables for velocity).

These will be calculated as follows:
* v1: Estimation of the velocity at the beginning of the interval 
** Simply, this will use the given initial velocity stored either at the end
	of the last iteration or given as input if it is the first iteration

* v2: Estimation of the velocity at time dt/2
** To calculate this velocity, we will need to run the RK4 method on the time
	interval - dt/2
** This will be done by calculating a1, a2, a3, and a4 as follows:
*** a1: Estimation of the acceleration at the beginning of the interval
**** First, we calculate the forces acting on the atom in our current coordinate
		axis with the initial geometry. 
**** Then, acceleration can be found as F = ma
*** a2: Estimation of the acceleration halfway through our time interval
**** Since our time interval of estimation is (dt/2) for the calculation of
		velocity, halfway will be at time=(dt/4)
